**Directory bruteforcing:**

200        1l        2w       38c http://10.129.1.190/index

```
- /dev seems interesting

![](https://i.imgur.com/WQQDhr4.png)
- It contains two files

```
# notes.txt

To do:

1) Coffee.
2) Research.
3) Fix decoder/encoder before going live.
4) Make sure encoding/decoding is only done client-side.
5) Don't use the decoder/encoder until any of this is done.
6) Find a better way to take notes.
```
-  And there's a long hex encoded string in `hype_key` file

![](https://i.imgur.com/0e6hfFX.png)
- Decoding that to ascii revealed that, it's a private key
- Also there's a `/encode` path it simply encodes the string into base64
- Then we can decode that text in `/decode` path (base64 -> ascii)

- Let's scan for some heart blead bugs

| ssl-ccs-injection: 
|   VULNERABLE:
|   SSL/TLS MITM vulnerability (CCS Injection)
|     State: VULNERABLE
|     Risk factor: High
|       OpenSSL before 0.9.8za, 1.0.0 before 1.0.0m, and 1.0.1 before 1.0.1h
|       does not properly restrict processing of ChangeCipherSpec messages,
|       which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to trigger use of a zero
|       length master key in certain OpenSSL-to-OpenSSL communications, and
|       consequently hijack sessions or obtain sensitive information, via
|       a crafted TLS handshake, aka the "CCS Injection" vulnerability.

| ssl-heartbleed: 
|   VULNERABLE:
|   The Heartbleed Bug is a serious vulnerability in the popular OpenSSL cryptographic software library. It allows for stealing information intended to be protected by SSL/TLS encryption.
|     State: VULNERABLE
|     Risk factor: High
|       OpenSSL versions 1.0.1 and 1.0.2-beta releases (including 1.0.1f and 1.0.2-beta1) of OpenSSL are affected by the Heartbleed bug. The bug allows for reading memory of systems protected by the vulnerable OpenSSL versions and could allow for disclosure of otherwise encrypted confidential information as well as the encryption keys themselves.

|     State: VULNERABLE
|     IDs:  BID:70574  CVE:CVE-2014-3566
|           The SSL protocol 3.0, as used in OpenSSL through 1.0.1i and other
|           products, uses nondeterministic CBC padding, which makes it easier
|           for man-in-the-middle attackers to obtain cleartext data via a
|           padding-oracle attack, aka the "POODLE" issue.

```
- The scan reveals it's vulnerable to **Heartbleed Bug**

![](https://i.imgur.com/kYdVV3F.png)
- Let's try this exploit

![](https://i.imgur.com/O8s306c.png)
- This text seems interesting let's decode that

```bash
âžœ  ~  echo "aGVhcnRibGVlZGJlbGlldmV0aGVoeXBlCg==" | base64 -d
heartbleedbelievethehype
```
- Looks like a password
- Let's use the previous hype_key to ssh now
- It asked for a passphrase, let's use this

![](https://i.imgur.com/HpEuNw5.png)
- Cool we logged in, I used hype as a user name here, it's just a guess with the file name `hype_key`
- Let's grab the user.txt

**privesc:**

![](https://i.imgur.com/Qz9mn4i.png)
- This file is interesting coz it's owned by root

![](https://i.imgur.com/Hvxozjr.png)
- Also there's  a session running as root
- simply we acn run that command `/usr/bin/tmux -S /.devs/dev_sess`
- to get that session coz that `/.devs/dev_sess` file is owned by hype group and that's us, we're having access to that file

![](https://i.imgur.com/KlrmMIP.png)
- Cool we rooted it!!
