### WebApp Enumeration

- Nothing fancy, just a static web page with zero dynamic functionality

![](https://i.imgur.com/OqowpEQ.png)

- It's a php site
- So, let's enumerate the nfs

### NFS enumeration

![](https://i.imgur.com/0d9L7sE.png)

- We can mount these folders to our local
- There's a `Passwords.kdbx` file in **ross** user's Documents directory

```js
âžœ  squashed keepass2john Passwords.kdbx
! Passwords.kdbx : File version '40000' is currently not supported!
```

- Unfortunately we can't able to crack it
- Let's check the other mounted folder `/var/www/`

![](https://i.imgur.com/LCfEReG.png)
- Only the uid `2017` and `www-data` has access to it
- Let's create a user in our box and give him the uid => `2017`

![](https://i.imgur.com/1YoqU6t.png)

- We changed his uid successfully

![](https://i.imgur.com/np13v0e.png)

- Now we can able to access the contents of the **html** folder

## INITIAL FOOTHOLD

- Let's try to create a file here and see it's available in the webpage or not

![](https://i.imgur.com/3nTgiu8.png)

- Now time for a php rev shell

![](https://i.imgur.com/y1KiO5x.png)

- 1) Editing the php-rev shell and starting a ncat listener
- 2) Copying the rev shell to the mounted `/var/www/html/` folder
- 3) Triggering the rev shell
- 4) Got shell as `alex`

- Grab the **user.txt** in alex's home directory

## PRIVESC

![](https://i.imgur.com/FdZ15pn.png)

```js
ross        1578  0.0  0.1   6892  3384 ?        S    03:16   0:00  |   _ /bin/bash /usr/share/keepassxc/scripts/ross/keepassxc-start
ross        1593  0.1  4.9 777124 101232 ?       SLl  03:16   0:05  |       _ /usr/bin/keepassxc --pw-stdin --keyfile /usr/share/keepassxc/keyfiles/ross/keyfile.key /usr/share/keepassxc/databases/ross/Passwords.kdbx
```

- We can't access these files, so we need to switch to ross

### X11

- Now let's enumerate the other mounted directory `/home/ross`

![](https://i.imgur.com/3Z0khET.png)

- These files are new to me, so I've reffered [0xdf's writeup](https://0xdf.gitlab.io/2022/11/21/htb-squashed.html#shell-as-root) & [Bookhacktricks](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/network-services-pentesting/6000-pentesting-x11)
- Here we can see we need the uid => `1001` to access these files, so let's do the thing that we did for the `2017` uid

![](https://i.imgur.com/Blw6wQT.png)

- Now we can able to access these files
- I'm going to copy these files to my local, coz mounted folders are slow

![](https://i.imgur.com/Uc2fQLj.png)

- This is `MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1` which means,

> MIT-magic-cookie-1: Generating 128bit of key ("cookie"), storing it in ~/.Xauthority (or where XAUTHORITY envvar points to). The client sends it to server plain! the splain! the server checks whether it has a copy of this "cookie" and if so, the connection is permitted. the key is generated by DMX.


- So we can use this file to authenticate

![](https://i.imgur.com/HRzPXbW.png)

- The display is connected in `:0`
- But we don't have access, so let's copy this file to alex's home directory

![](https://i.imgur.com/sASeGiT.png)

- I'm setting `XAUTHORITY=/home/alex/.Xauthority`, so it checks this file and we will be authenticated

![](https://i.imgur.com/KTRTcya.png)

- Now we can do multiple things, Interestingly we can take screenshots
- That's explained [here](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/network-services-pentesting/6000-pentesting-x11#screenshots-capturing)

```js
xwd -root -screen -silent -display :0 > screenshot.xwd
```

![](https://i.imgur.com/3Aj51hB.png)

- 1) Sucessfully took the screenshot
- 2) But we don't have convert
- 3) So let's start a python server
- 4) And wget it to our local

![](https://i.imgur.com/C8S2Kmv.png)

- Converted it to `png` format
- We can see the root user's password there

![](https://i.imgur.com/waOggx3.png)

- creds => `root:cah$mei7rai9A`
- It worked and we're root!!
